## Naming conventions
**aaronsven96**: Generally people use camel case for Json property names or underscores.

We should decide what way we want to name them. Maybe we should add a wiki page to this project with naming conventions.

**ksve**: camelCase seems to be the better option since it's consistent with our variable naming.
